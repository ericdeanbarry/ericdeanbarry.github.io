The Supreme Court Ruling regarding Marriage Equality has stirred up much feeling on the issue, both for and against.

I still can't get myself to consider the [Court's](http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/26/supreme-court-recognizes-a-constitutiona) ruling to be a victory for liberty. Sure, it means that law regarding the privilege associated with a state marriage license is now equal, but as a libertarian, I still view this as an issue in which the state should not be involved.

My belief is that the state has no moraly right to be involved in marriage, especially how marriage is defined and who will officiate over said marriages. More on that second point in another post. The ruling is a victory for equality, but is it the victory for liberty that many libertarians are claiming?

I still don't have an answer to that question. I hope to flesh out my views and feelings on the matter in a reasoned fashion. Because I do know this: the emotional state many are in is not the state in which to determine the real value of this ruliung.
