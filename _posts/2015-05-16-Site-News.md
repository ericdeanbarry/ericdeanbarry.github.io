I'm pretty excited about what's going on! I have the categories started, which is important given that is the primary navigation method. So far, Site Stuff is the only working category.

{{ more }}

I also have a lot of CSS work to do. Since I've forked ( a method of copying an existing theme as a foundation ) from two different sites, most of the formatting is missing. That will be fixed in time. Next step is to finish the category and tag navigations.

I also need to work on social media sharing. Then I can work on CSS.

I've worked with WordPress too long. I've forgotten how much work is required to make a site function and look good.
