Definintely won't be blogging daily for a while. I wanted to have a second post just so I can see the site formatting.

I'm using the "blog aware" software called Jekyll. It is the default for GitHub Pages, where this site is currenly located. I still have a lot of configuration and theme work ahead of me, so many of the near future changes will be look and feel more than content.

First up is how I want the front page to be formatted. Still not sure if I want the latest post or a list. Then the important tagging and comments sections. Sharing is next, and the actual theme last.

I'll keep you posted.
