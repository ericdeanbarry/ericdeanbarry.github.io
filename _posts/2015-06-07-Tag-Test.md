So I'm testing a category tag feature I found.

{{ more }}

I've been trying to find a way to list posts in categories in Jekyll. This is still an under developed feature, so I've been looking at what others are doing.

I found one that lists each post in each category. So, this should give me a list with the categories Site and Personal. If this works, I will try to tie categories into each static page I have on the site.
