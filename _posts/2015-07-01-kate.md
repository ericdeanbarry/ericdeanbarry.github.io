There are certainly more powerful editors for Linux, but KATE is my preferred.

{{ more }}

I've used a number of text editors over the years, from the simple like Notepad, to full blown word processors like LibreOffice Writer. But none seem to serve all my needs better than KATE. KATE stands for K Advanced Text Editor and applies a layer of modes, from Assemblers to text to source and overlays the Kwrite text editor to provide greater functionality.

With KATE I can simply create and edit a single document and it will adjust the code base from the extension used. I can also create multiple document projects so I can manage updates to several documents at once. I can even use it to post to my site, which is the document that appears in the image above.

KATE is lightweight and fast, adding only that code to the file that you either manually select in the Modes section, or based on the file extension. Anyone that has used Word to process a web page knows how much garbage code it includes in the page. In the case of this file, it will not be more than a kilobite in size. Yet it is powerful enought to create scripting, PHP, Perl, Ruby, and other language files.

My personal reasons for liking KATE are simple. It is free, both as in money and in beer (Open source and no cost). It is easy to use. It is fast and flexible. It is also native to KDE, which is my favorite Linux Desktop Environment.

Are there better, more powerful text editors? Certainly. But in a pinch, I'll use KATE, every time.
