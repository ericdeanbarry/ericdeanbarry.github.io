One thing is certain. This site is not going to code itself!

{{ more }}

It's been a while since I put fingers to keyboard on this site. One part system issues, one part other things, three parts me being a lazy writer. I figured when I started this that it would be as easy as writing notes or emails. I lack purpose. So I don't write.

As with all things, I have to start somewhere. I have a personal journal in which I also rarely write. I send emails, but that's not writing. I tweet. See the last half of two sentences ago. I have plenty of thoughts in my head. I just need to get in the habit of writing them down. And there is the answer to my problem. I need some better habits.

So sorry if the next few posts are boring. It's just me learning how to write. Often.
