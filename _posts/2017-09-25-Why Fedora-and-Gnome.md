It's the simplicity of the environment. It's the ease of use. That's why I like Fedora (a Linux distribution based on Redhat) and Gnome (the GTK desktop environment). If you are looking for something indepth, this is not it. Maybe more as I begin to get back into the nuts and bolts of Linux...

[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) is really no better or worse than most mainstream distributions. They have made both the command line and graphical package managers easy to use. This is the reason to use one distribution over another: how packages are installed and managed. I've used apt, yum (now dnf) and pacman. dnf just works. Nothing special about it.

[Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) has come a long way since they switched to the Shell. Frankly the default theme is still ugly. But that does not take much to fix. A couple of downloads and tweaks and you have a simple and elegant desktop. I like the design philosophy of making apps that do one thing well. Still a long way to go since Evolution is still the default email app, but it's getting there.

I'm also looking forward to a Linux phone/tablet solution. [Purism](https://puri.sm/) is getting there.
