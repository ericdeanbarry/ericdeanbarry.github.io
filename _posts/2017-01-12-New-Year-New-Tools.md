It's a brand new year. New resolutions. New tools.

{{ more }}

Yep! Brand new. Currently I'm using Fedora Desktop version 25. Comes with Gnome 3.22.x and all its goodies, including Gnome Builder.

Gnome Builder is an robust IDE, which includes many programming and markdown languages and can clone/push to your git repository. So I can use it to post to and update my site. Now if it included motivation as well!

You can see more [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder)

What I'd like to do this year:

* Write more on this site
* Learn a programming language so I can get better employment
* Step into the gig economy

That's it for now. Nothing too serious or comprehensive. At least not today.
