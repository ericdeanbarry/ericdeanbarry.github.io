Navigation on the site via Categories has been a mild issue. Well, mild in that I'm a relative newbie to coding a site without using Wordpress...

Jekyll is a great static site generator. It has one flaw in that post tag and category navigation is still underdeveloped. If one is hosting their own site, this is not an issue as there are many plugins available to use. If one is using [GitHib pages](https://pages.github.com/) such as I am, that is a different matter. GitHub pages does not use plugins as a matter of security and stability. Thankfully there is a large community of novices and experts that have solved issues such as mine already.

So now I have a list of Category Pages on the site to be used both for a static description of the category in question and for a list of posts in that category. With only two real site format issues left to work on (pagination and archives) I can focus on content.
